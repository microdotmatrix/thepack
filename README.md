Made this repo to hold a basic skeleton package I've pieced together of the tools I would start pretty much any web development project with. It is simple, relatively unopinionated, and easy to configure. Quick synopsis:

### NPM DevDependencies:
- Webpack utilized with Laravel Mix
- ES5/6 JS Module Bundling for Javascript
- SASS preprocessing and PostCSS (plugged with Autoprefixer, Import and Custom Props) for CSS

I start with Laravel's Mix Webpack Bundler (stand-alone NPM package that runs independent of Laravel) just because it's simple. Can utilize the essential functions of Webpack with a really straightforward configuration syntax. SASS and PostCSS for all my CSS compiling, which may seem redundant but if combined effectively they are extremely handy and work well together. I use SASS for everything, have been a devoted user of this preprocessor since it first launched, so I don't leave my homepage without it... PostCSS has a lot of nifty unique features of its own to compliment it, and since I've recently adopted Tailwind as my cute redheaded style stepchild, PostCSS became essential.

Expanding on this foundation, I have a couple of templating and aesthetic development packages for my front end toolkit that I typically find useful in just about any project...
- jQuery
- GSAP
- Gerillass
- Accoutrement
- Tailwind v.3
- Open Props
- Bootstrap Icons
- Luge
